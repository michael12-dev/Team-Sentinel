## 📋 Overview  
This project was developed as part of the **HR / Workforce Analytics: Employee Attrition Prediction** case study.  
Our goal is to build a **classification model** that predicts whether an employee will leave or stay based on various HR-related factors.

## 🧩 Project Workflow  

### 📘 Phase 1 — Data Loading & Inspection  
- Import required libraries  
- Load dataset from Kaggle (using `kagglehub`)  
- Inspect structure, datatypes, missing values, and duplicates  

### 📊 Phase 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize data distributions and relationships  
- Identify correlations, outliers, and key insights  

### 🧹 Phase 3 — Data Preprocessing  
- Encode categorical variables  
- Scale/standardize numeric features  
- Drop non-informative columns (e.g., `EmployeeCount`, `Over18`, `StandardHours`)  

### 🤖 Phase 4 — Model Building & Evaluation  
- Split data into train/test sets  
- Build and tune a Logistic Regression model  
- Evaluate model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  

### 🧾 Phase 5 — Presentation & Reporting  
- Write a Medium article summarizing methods and insights  
- Create a PowerPoint presentation with visuals and recommendations
